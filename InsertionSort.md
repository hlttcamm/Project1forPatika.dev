- step 1: [2,27.16,22,18.6]
- step 2: [2,6,16,22,18,27]
- step 3: [2,6,16,18,22,27]
### The Big-O notation: *O(n^2)

## After the array is sorted, the number wiil be **average**.Because it is in the middle of the array. That is why, ***avarege case*** is true answer

# [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] write four steps of the array according to Insertion Sort
* step 1: [2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6]
* step 2: [2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6]
* step 3: [2,3,4,8,7,9,5,15,6]
* step 4: [2,3,4,5,7,9,8,15,6]
